tdl does not use autoconf.

Edit the supplied Makefile and change

prefix : where you want the program & manpage to be installed
CC, CFLAGS : the C compiler and options you want to use

Then just type

    make
    make install

To get started,

    tdl create
    tdl add "Some task I have to do"
    tdl list

It's suggested that you try

    man tdl

as well.
