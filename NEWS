NEW IN VERSION 0.8

- Fix: don't complain if the links tdla, tdll etc already exist when installing.

- Add -q option to suppress "no database" warning.

- Fix: initialise 'parent' properly when creating nodes

- Allow dates to be specified for 'add' and 'done'.  'list' ignores entries

- New before and after commands with identical operation to above and below.

- List command now shows only items of at least normal priority by default, and
  can take a priority argument.

- New import and export commands

- The remove, done and priority commands can take indices of the form 1... to

- Priorities can be specified by just their initial letter (or any bigger
  substring)

- Add tdlg to do log as a single command name.
