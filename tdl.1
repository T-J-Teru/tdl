.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.B tdl above
.I index_to_insert_above
.I index_to_move ...
.PP
This command moves one or more entries to a new location in the tree.  The
first index specifies the entry which will end up immediately below the moved
entries after the operation.  As a special case, you can specify the final
component of the first argument as zero.  In this case, the moved entries
appear as the last children of the parent node afterwards.

.I [parent_index]

.br
.B tdla
.I [parent_index]
.I [priority]
.I text_for_node
.PP
The
.B add
command is used to add a new entry to the database.
.PP
.B parent_index
is the index of the parent node (e.g. 1 or 2.4).  This defaults to the root node if missing, i.e. a new top-level entry is created.
.PP
.B priority is one of
.IR urgent ,
.IR high ,
.IR normal ,
.IR low " or"
.IR verylow .
Normal is the default if this argument is not specified.
.PP
.B text_for_node
is the text describing the task for this entry.  If this is more than a single
word, you will need to quote it to make the shell keep it as a single argument
to tdl.  The text may span multiple lines (i.e. if you hit return whilst the
quotation marks are still open in the shell.)
.PP
If no database exists, the
.B add
command will create it automatically (in the current directory, unless the
.B TDL_DATABASE
environment is set, in which case this specifies the path to use).

.B tdl below
.I index_to_insert_below
.I index_to_move ...
.PP
This command moves one or more entries to a new location in the tree.  The
first index specifies the entry which will end up immediately above the moved
entries after the operation.  As a special case, you can specify the final
component of the first argument as zero.  In this case, the moved entries
appear as the first children of the parent node afterwards.

.PP
.B tdl done
.I index_of_done_entry ...
.PP
.B tdld
.I index_of_done_entry ...
.PP
The
.B done
command is used to mark one or more tasks as completed.  The effects are as follows:
.IP o
The entries no longer appear on the default listing (tdl list / tdll)
.IP o
The entries are eligible to appear on the report list (tdl report)
.IP o
The entries are eligible for removal by the purge command (tdl purge.)

.B tdl edit
.I index_to_change

.PP
This command is used to change the text of an entry.

.PP
.B tdl into
.I new_parent_index
.I indices_to_move ...
.PP
This command moves one or more entries under a new parent entry.  It is
equivalent to the
.B above
command when the
.B new_parent_index
argument has ".0" appended to it.

.br
.B tdll
.I [-v]
.I [-a]
.I [-m]
.I [<parent_index> ...]
.PP
The
.B list
command is used to display the entries in the database.  By default, only
entries that have not been marked
.B done
are shown.  If you want to display all entries, include the
.B -a
option (which means 'all').  If you want to display the dates and times when
the entries were added and/or done, include the 
.B -v
option (which means 'verbose').
.PP
By default, the whole database is scanned.  If you only want to show part(s) of
the database, additional arguments can be given.  These are the indices of the
top node of each part of the database you want to show.  So if your database
contains entries with indices 1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, 3 and 4, the command
.PP
tdl list -a 2
.PP
will show all entries 2, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.2.1, whether or not they are completed.
.PP
By default, the listing is produced with colour highlighting.  The
.B -m
option can be used to produce a monochrome listing instead.  Alternatively, the
.B TDL_LIST_MONOCHROME
enviroment variable can be set (to any value) to achieve the same effect.
.PP
The colours are assigned as follows:

.B tdl log
.PP
This command is used to add a new entry and mark it done immediately.  It is
most useful in conjunction with the
.B report
command, to record unexpected extra tasks you had to do.
.PP
The arguments for the
.B log
command are the same as those for the
.B add
command.

.PP
.B tdl pri
.I new_priority
.I index_to_change ...
.PP
This command changes the priority of one or more entries.  The indices are in
the same format as those in the output of the
.B list
command.  The
.B new_priority
argument takes the same possible values as for the
.B add
command.

.PP
.B tdl purge
.I since_epoch
.I [entry_index...]
.PP
This command is used to remove old done entries from the database.  It is much more convenient than repeated
.B remove
commands.
.PP
The
.B since_epoch
argument specifies a time in the past.  The time is specified as an interval
before the current time, in the same way as the
.B report
command uses.  Entries that were marked done (using the
.B done
command) before that epoch will be purged.
.PP
Zero or more
.B entry_indices
may be given.  These restrict the purging to just those entries and their
descendents.  The default is to purge the entire database.
.P
.ce 1
--ooOOoo--
.PP
.B tdl remove
.I index_to_remove ...
.PP
Completely remove one or more entries from the database.  The indices are the
same format as those shown in the output of the
.B list
command.

.PP
.B tdl report
.I start_time_ago
.I [end_time_ago]
.PP
The
.B report
command produces a report (in bulleted list format) of tasks completed in a
certain time period.  This is useful if (for example) you have to write a
weekly summary of the work you've done.
.PP
The default for the end of the time period is the current time, if the
.B end_time_ago
argument is not present.  The start of the period to report on must always be
specified.  The format is a number of time units in the past relative to the
current time.  Examples :
.PP
tdl report 1w
.PP
will list all tasks completed in the previous week, whereas
.PP
tdl report 2w 1w
.PP
will list all tasks completed between 2 and 1 weeks ago.
.PP
The times can be specified in any of the following formats : 1y (1 year), 2m (2
months), 3w (3 weeks), 4d (4 days), 5h (5 hours), 6 (6 seconds).

.SH AUTHOR
.PP
I am Richard P. Curnow.  My email address is <richard@rrbcurnow.freeuk.com>.
If that fails to get through, try <rpc@myself.com> or <richard.curnow@go.to>.

.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.PP
I got the idea from a program called devtodo.  I liked what that program did
and the command line approach to using it, but I ran into lots of compilation
problems with it on older C++ installations.  I decided the solution was to
hack up a pure C program to do a similar job.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
TDL_DATABASE
If this variable is set, it defines the name of the file to use for holding the
database of tasks.  If the variable is not set, the search approach described
in the FILES section is used.
.TP
TDL_LIST_MONOCHROME
If this variable is set, the output from the
.B list
command is produced in monochrome instead of colour (the default).
.SH FILES
.TP
 ./.tdldb, ../.tdldb, ../../.tdldb, ...
If the TDL_DATABASE environment variable is not present, the file .tdldb in the
current directory is used, if that is present.  If not, the same file in the
parent directory is used, and so on, until the root directory of the filesystem
is reached.  If the database is still not found, a new one will be created in
the current directory (except for options that don't modify the database, such
as list, help and version.)

.SH BUGS
Please report them to the author.  None are known of at the moment.
